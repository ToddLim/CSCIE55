EXTRACREDIT.TXT


Instructions: Extra credit. Run your M/R app against HDFS; then catch the last ten lines sent by
              $ hadoop fs -tail output/part-r-00000 | tail > hd.tail
              Run your solution locally, and catch the final 10 lines from the output:
              $ tail output/part-r-00000 > local.tail
              Compare the local vs. HDFS results.
              $ diff hd.tail local.tail

Description:
Upon following the instructions, there is no difference in output from running the M/R app, WordHistogram, on either
HDFS or locally. The last ten lines from the HDFS output match the local output. You can also find the JAR file I used
in CSCIE55_HW6_FALL2017/; it is called 'WordHistogram.jar'. Please see below for more information on results.
