HW8 README.MD

Problem 1's BeerFest.java doesn't seem to be working, though Problem 2's Anagrams.java does yield results. The results
for Problem 2 are in SampleOutput.txt, and the expected results for Problem 1 are also in SampleOutput.txt.

QUESTION: How can you execute the solution?
ANSWER: Download the JAR files, and then run this command in the Terminal (be in the parent directory of files):

java -classpath $CLASSPATH cscie55.hw8.cscie55.hw8.BeerFest
java -classpath $CLASSPATH cscie55.hw8.cscie55.hw8.Anagrams

Please set your program arguments correctly as well, though it was not used in my case.
